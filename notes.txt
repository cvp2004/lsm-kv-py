- improvements
[COMPLETED] 1. the worker threads should run from start itself. (ThreadPoolExecutor workers start on first task, but pool is initialized at startup)
2. compaction
3. multi-level SSTable Tree
4. Client Server implementation
5. UI
6. Evaluate Codon Cimpiler for optimizing performance

[COMPLETED] Update the compaction and merge policy to trigger at 85% of actual hard limit. 
[COMPLETED] But ensure that the background thread for flush / compact / merge doesn't block main thread while read / writes.

[COMPLETED] Also, update the manifests to support a separate manifest for each level.

[COMPLETED] Also, add logic to ensure the background thread gets a snapshot of actual SSTables to perform operations and once the new SSTable is persisted to disk, 
only then the actual SSTables are deleted and manifests for the resepctive levels are updated.

[COMPLETED] Also, don't load the actual SSTables to memory on start. only load them when they are actually needed for read operations. 
[COMPLETED] just load the SSTable metadata from manifest during startup. 
[COMPLETED] Also, after any Manifest is updated, the manifest objects in memory are deleted and reloaded to get latest data. 
[COMPLETED] This is also done by background thread. 
[COMPLETED] Also, ensure until new map / collection of SSTable Metadata is ready, old ones are preserved.

[COMPLETED] Optimized mmap reads: only read bytes between floor and ceil from sparse index (0.4% of file for typical lookups).
